    projectInfo: [
      "Developed a multi-stage pipeline to bridge the gap between abstract command interpretation and physically grounded execution for domestic service robots. The pipeline consists of an automated process to generate a task-specific dataset for fine-tuning LLMs, a model-agnostic schema-aligned parsing system that guarantees syntactically valid plans and prevents action-level hallucinations, and a pre-execution grounding stage using a vectorized knowledge base to align commands with the robot’s real-world perception.",
      "The system was scoped for and benchmarked using commands from the RoboCup at Home GPSR task. Experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned model, deployed on the robot’s embedded hardware (Jetson AGX Orin), achieves a 96.5% success rate on linguistically diverse commands, outperforming both the non-fine-tuned baseline (29.6%) and a leading cloud-based model (90.4%). Furthermore, the schema-aligned parser proved to be 11% more dependable than standard token constrained generation methods.",
